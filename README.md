# RustyFlow
First attempt at using rust. Trying to finally make this flow solver

(Update) I became frustrated when I got to implementing a tree like structure.  Cyclical references are not very friendly. In any case it's been two commits since I was actually invested in the quality of the code. Since then the frustration has lead me to writing such terrible code that it's counter-productive. I will come back to this later.
